## The best definition of Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing -> ubiquitous , convinient, on-demand network access to shared configurable computing resource pool,
rapidly provisined and released with minimal management.
- The shared configurable resource pool = [ networks, server, storage, applications and services ]
- Cloud model composed of 5 essential characteristics, 3 service models, 4 deployment model. (534)
- Reference = https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/145/final
  
### 5 Essential Characteristics (BROME) :
- BROME : Broad Network Access, Resource Pooling, On Demand Self service, Measured Service, Elastic (Rapid Elasticity)
### 3 Service Models (IPS) :
- IAAS, PAAS, SAAS
### 4 Deployment Model (PHPC) :
- Public, Hybrid, Private, Communitiy

| Aspect               | Parallel Computing    | Distributed Computing |
|----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| Architecture         | Single system         | Multiple systems      |
| Memory               | Shared                | Distributed           |
| Scalability          | Limited               | Highly scalable       |
| Fault Tolerance      | Low                   | High                  |
